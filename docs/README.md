# My Calendar
#### An app for the poor planners.

## Why?
This app originated from my own lack of planning in my daily life. There are so many times that I regret procrastinating my schoolwork and there are so many times that I plan on doing it different next time, but in the end I don't. So, this app might be handy for people who have a hard time planning their schoolwork (or are just too lazy to do it): what am I supposed to do, how much time do I have and what is the best way to spread this over the days while the events that are already planned in my calendar aren't forgotten. To help the user in all of these things the following tools are available in the app:

The app will be connected to your own Google Calendar. The goal of this tool is to give you an overview of the events that you've already planned in your Google Calendar and suggestions for when you could do the items from you Todo list 

### Todo list

For Todo items to be suggested in your Calendar it might be handy to have a Todo list where you can add these. To add an item you need to add some additional details as well: the title, the estimated time spend on doing this and the deadline. The deadline is the day the item should be done. Say you have to finish reading an article by the 30th, if you set the 30th as the deadline, the app will see the 29th as the last day that this Todo item can be planned.

Besides the estimated time spent on an item and the deadline, there are also a couple of other tools that make it possible to personalise this app even more. The user is able to set the time that he/she will be sleeping, the user is able to set a time gap between the activities and Todo items. And it's also possible to set a Time Frame or Time Span to plan. If the user has an exam in two weeks, then Time Span can be set to 14 days. The maximum Time Span is 84 days (7 days a week * 4 weeks a month * 3 months).
